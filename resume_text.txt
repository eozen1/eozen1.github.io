Experience
Apple

May 2025 – August 2025
Software Engineering Intern | CoreOS, Virtualization, MCP
Cupertino, CA
• Architected and deployed a multi-agent AI triage tool for 1600+ engineers, automating root-cause analysis and reducing
manual triage time by 70%.
• Developed a scalable backend service using MCP servers to orchestrate AI agents that autonomously analyze large logs,
query internal ticketing systems, and interface with debugging tools to generate actionable debugging steps.
• Integrated the platform into Apple’s CI framework using webhooks to automatically analyze nightly test failures.
• Resolved critical bugs in high-performance virtual machine (VM) network drivers by re-engineering state management
logic, significantly improving network reliability and system performance at scale.
• Selected as one of 10 interns company-wide to present to Apple’s SVP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi.

OKSI

May 2024 – May 2025
Software Engineering Intern | Machine Learning, LoRA, AWQ, NATS.io
Torrance, CA
• Secured a $1.5M contract renewal from DARPA after presenting an end-to-end AI automation platform.
• Deployed Llama-3 on edge devices with 400% less VRAM by leveraging activation aware weight quantization.
• Developed a full-stack React application featuring an NLP pipeline with LoRA fine-tuning, NATS.io, & Synadia Cloud.
• Architected a PDF form processing microservice that reduced manual entry with an auto-populating question-wizard.
• Developed GNC algorithms for a drone with path planning and SLAM in ROS2 for real-world autonomous navigation.

OKSI

June 2023 – August 2023
Software Engineering Intern | Embedded Systems, SLAM, IMU, GPS
Torrance, CA
• Orchestrated configuration and calibration of multispectral cameras, GPS, and IMU for machine-learning applications.
• Evaluated camera drivers on a Google Coral Board, implementing debayering techniques for optimal performance.
• Developed high-speed serial communication between microcontrollers and avionics, focusing on data pipeline efficiency.
• Implemented simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using LiDAR, IMU, and GPS for autonomous navigation.

Projects
Vidur Autoscaling | LLM Inference Simulator Extension
Fall 2025
• Implemented reactive autoscaling policies for distributed LLM inference using traffic analysis and throughput estimation
• Optimized O(1) traffic envelope algorithms for real-time token arrival rate tracking in production systems
• Developed LOR scheduler with autoscaling awareness to minimize latency during replica scale-down operations
• Engineered custom autoscaling policy generating Pareto-optimal latency-cost trade-offs across service levels
UNIX Kernel Development | OS development for a UNIX v6 Kernel
Spring 2025
• Implemented core OS components for a UNIX V6-based teaching OS in ANSI C on x86, including the bootloader, virtual
memory management, file system, and CPU scheduling
• Developed system-level functionality such as interrupts, concurrency mechanisms, user and kernel threading, and basic
networking, focusing on process execution, resource management, and inter-process communication
